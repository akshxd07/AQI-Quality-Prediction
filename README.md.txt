# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing air quality data and building a machine learning
model to predict AQI values based on pollutant levels.

## What this project does
- Creates and processes AQI dataset
- Trains a machine learning model to predict AQI
- Evaluates model performance using R² score
- Saves the trained model for reuse

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (basic interface – work in progress)

## Project Status
- Data analysis and model training: Completed
- Web application interface: In progress
